# Discord Bot
This is a simple Discord bot written in Kotlin that uses [JDA](https://jda.wiki/introduction/jda/).

## Setup & Deployment


### Prerequisites
* A Discord application
  * Create your Discord application [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
  * You will need the auth token for the app
  * Once your application is set up, you can open the following invite link in your browser.
    It includes all the permissions the bot needs. You need to replace the client ID.
    ```
    https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=[ENTER_YOUR_ID]&permissions=8&integration_type=0&scope=bot
    ```
* Local machine with:
  * Java 17 or higher
  * OCI-runtime (e.g. Docker)
  * docker-compose v2
* Debian/Ubuntu Server with:
  * docker-compose
  * SSH access
  * Java 17 or higher
  * [Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/manual/screen.html#Invoking-Screen)

### Local setup
1. Clone the repository
2. In the `config` directory, add an `application-prod.yml` file. 
   Find a template with explanations to copy in [config/application-prod.yml.template](config/application-prod.yml.template).

#### When developing
You can also create a `application-dev.yml` file in the `config` directory.
This creates a second profile which you can use while developing and debugging.
It enables you to configure different Discord servers and channels for this purpose while still remaining the prod config.
This profile is also the default profile.

### Deployment
To deploy the bot, you first need to copy the [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) file to the server and run `docker-compose up -d`.

After that, you can run the deployment script [`deploy.sh`](deploy.sh).
This will build the project locally, copy the jar file to the server, and start the bot in a detached screen session
**using the prod profile**.

To run the script, you can pass your username and the host name like this: `./deploy.sh -u USERNAME -d HOSTNAME`
When you just execute the script without passing these arguments, the script will ask you for them.

You could also build the project on the server and run it there by yourself,
but this script automates the process for you
and creates a good [directory structure](#directory-structure) and a logging configuration on the server.

### Run the tests

#### Unit Tests
The deployment script already runs all unit tests before packaging the application.

You can run them separately with the Gradle task `check`:

```shell
./gradlew check
```

Find the test results in [the test report](app/build/reports/tests/test/index.html) afterwards.

#### Integration Tests
Additionally to the unit tests, there are some integration tests that connect to a local database (in a docker container
using [Zonky Embedded Database](https://github.com/zonkyio/embedded-database-spring-test)), to the Wiktionary API, and
to a Discord server.

While the database runs completely locally, the Discord server has to be a "real" one.
In order for the Discord-related integration tests to run, see configuration file [application.yml](app/src/integTest/resources/application.yml)
in the integration test source set (`integTest`) and set the environment variables that are needed there. Use e.g., a
run configuration in your IDE for that.

You can run the integration tests with the Gradle task `integTest`:

```shell
./gradlew app:integTest
```

## On the server

### Directory structure
When you used the deployment script earlier, the directory structure on the server should look like this:
```
.
â””â”€â”€ discord-bot
 Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ bin
 Â Â  â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ [ALL APP AND LIBRARY FILES]
 Â Â  â””â”€â”€ logs
 Â Â      â””â”€â”€ [LOG FILES WITH TIMECODE]
```

### Reading logs
To read the logs, you have two options:
* Attach to the screen session and see the logs of the current run in real-time:
    ```bash
    screen -DR "bot_run"
    ```
  To detach from the screen session again without stopping it, press `CTRL+A` and then `D`.
* Read the log files in the `logs` directory which are named with a timestamp.
  Every new run will create a new log file.
  * `ls -l` in the `discord-bot/logs` directory will show you the names of the log files with their timestamps.
  * `cat [FILE NAME]` in the same directory will show you the content of the log file.

### Stopping the bot
To stop the bot, enter the following command on the server:
```bash
screen -XS bot_run quit
```


## Functions

### Commands
* `/ding` - Responds with "Dong!" and only works in the channel with the name "ðŸ¤–ï½œbot-spielplatz"
